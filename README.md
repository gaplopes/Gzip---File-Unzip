# Gzip---File-Unzip

## Description

This is an implementation of the decoder algorithm _deflate_ used in the gzip file format. In particular, this module uses the Huffman coding algorithm and LZ77 dictionaries to decode the compressed data.

The project is a part of the course "Information Theory" at the University of Coimbra for the 2016/2017 academic year for the Informatics Engineering degree.

Note: The project statement is in Portuguese and can be found in the pdf file "Project Statement.pdf".

The project code is written in C++ and uses the C++11 standard.

## Code

The code can be found in the folder `code` and is divided in the following files:

* `gzip.cpp`: Contains the main function and the code to read the input file and write the output file.

* `gzip.h`: Contains the declarations of the functions used in the project.

* `huffman.cpp`: Contains the code to decode the Huffman coding algorithm.

* `huffman.h`: Contains the declarations of the functions used in the Huffman coding algorithm.
